<!--with the inventory system, you must be careful of adding items more than once. These examples show ways to add items avoding that.
They also show how to add class specfic items.-->

Example 1: simple way to add items to avoid duplication. You can change the passage text or leave it the same depending on what works best for your story.

<h1>Ruby</h1>
(if: $inv contains "Ruby")[You are in a dark room lit with torches. The chest you opened is empty.

[[Go left?->left passage]]]

(else:)[(set: $inv to $inv + (a: "Ruby"))
You are in a dark room lit with torches. Inside a chest you find a ruby!

[[what's behind the door?->observation rooms corridor]]]
  

Example 2: Class dependent items.
<h1>Grandma</h1>

(if: $inv's length < 1)[
Your Grandma gives you something to use on your adventure!

(if: $class is "Mage")[(set: $inv to $inv + (a: "Spellbook")) (set: $gold to 10) She hands you a small ''spellbook'' and some gold coins..]
(if: $class is "Warrior")[(set: $inv to $inv + (a: "Sword")) (set: $gold to 10)She hands you a ''sword'' and some gold coins.. ]
(if: $class is "Rouge")[(set: $inv to $inv + (a: "Slingshot"))(set: $gold to 10) She hands you your ''slingshot'' and some gold coins.]]
