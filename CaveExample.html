You want treasure do you...

[Check the rusty chest?]<1a|

[Check the shiny new chest?]<1b|

<!--If you want to injure the player, health bars are static so to make the bar update, you have to send the player to a new passage. Remember to add the health removing code there!-->
(click:?1a)[(goto: "Ow!")]

<!--The same for the gold statistic.-->
(click:?1b)[(goto: "Gold")]

<!--examples of those two passages. Still working on a way to send the player back to this passage without them getting gold each time.
However if you feel mean you can have them choose repetedly to injure themselves without breaking the game.-->

<h1>Ow!</h1>
<!--You will need to tag this hideinventory and hidequest for now to stop duplicate health removal. Not worked out a nicer way around this yet.-->
{(set:$health to $health -5)}
The chest is full of broken glass! Ouch. Who even does that?


<h1>Gold</h1>
<!--You will need to tag this hideinventory and hidequest for now to stop duplicate health removal. Not worked out a nicer way around this yet.-->
{(set:$gold to $gold +5)}
The chest is full of gold! nice.
