# TwineAdventure
A repository of Twine code for a fantasy adventure game. Inculdes an inventory system, quest system, health, magic, money and charater classes.
There are also example passages showing how best to use this code, or just fun things you could do with a Harlowe Twine game that works with my system.


Please credit me and link to this github page if you use this code. Feel free to modify it too. And please send me a link to what you do with it! I'd love to see. :D

Working:


Health system.

Cosumable items that restore health or magic.

Inventory system

Quest system.

Location information.

Charater classes (with class dependent narrative and item acquisition.)

Buying items system. 

Adding to and removing player money.


In development:

Selling items system.

Magic system (Think this will be easy to impliment.)
