# TwineAdventure
A repository of Twine code for a fantasy adventure game. Inculdes an inventory system, quest system, health, magic, money and charater classes.
There are also example passages showing how best to use this code, or just fun things you could do with a Harlow Twine game that works with my system.


Please credit me and link to this github page if you use this code. Feel free to modify it too. And please send me a link to what you do with it! I'd love to see. :D

Working:


Health system.

Inventory system

Refined adding and removing items.

Quest system.

Location information.

Charater classes (with class dependent narrative and item acquisition.)

Buying system

Refined adding and removing gold.


In development:

Selling system.

Cosumable items that restore health or magic.

Magic system (mostly what to do when you run out of magic and try to cast a spell. Think this will be easy to impliment.)
