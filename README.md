# TwineAdventure
A repository of Twine code for a fantasy adventure game. Inculdes an inventory system, quest system, health, magic, money and charater classes.
There are also example passages showing how best to use this code, or just fun things you could do with a Harlowe Twine game that works with my system.


Please credit me and link to this github page if you use this code. Feel free to modify it too. And please send me a link to what you do with it! I'd love to see. :D

Planned related projects

TwineAdventureLite - a simpler version of this code with only inventory, health and gold.
Easy to make but not when you're distracted with this project.

TwineAdventureClass+ - a more complex version of the class system with statistics and class dependent health and magic values. I'll build after Twine Adventure is complete.

TwineAdevntureStyles - stylesheets designed to work well with this code.
