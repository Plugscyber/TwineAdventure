# TwineAdventure
A repository of Twine code for a fantasy adventure game. Inculdes an inventory system, quest system, health, magic, money and charater classes.
There are also example passages showing how best to use this code, or just fun things you could use for a Harlow Twine game that work with this system.


Feel free to use and modify but please credit me and link back to this Github page!

Working:


Health system

Inventory system

Quest system

Location information

Charater classes (with class dependent narrative and item acquisition.)

Buying system


In development:

Selling system.

Cosumable items that restore health or magic.

Magic system (mostly what to do when you run out of magic and try to cast a spell. Think this will be easy to impliment.)
