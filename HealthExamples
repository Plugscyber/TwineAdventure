<!--Add health-->

<!--Example 2: Consumable health items.
I'll make this fantasy themed later. For now I'm happy the code works.-->

<h1>Park</h1>
This park is a nice place to eat and test consumable items.

(If: $inv contains "Cone of chips")[Eat a ''cone of chips''?(click:"cone of chips")[(goto: "Yum1")]]

(If: $inv contains "Small fish and chips")[Eat a ''Small fish and chips''?(click:"Small fish and chips")[(goto:"Yum2")]]

(If: $inv contains "Large fish and chips")[Eat a ''Large fish and chips''?
(click:"Large fish and chips")[(goto:"Yum3")]]

(else:)[You have nothing to eat.]

--
<!--make sure the passage name in the goto matches up right to the passage name of the passages you make. 
If you want the player to be able to use up more items to add to their health, link to the last passage.-->
<h1>Yum!</h1>
(set: $health to $health + 5)(set: $inv to $inv - (a: "Cone of chips"))
You eat the chips and feel better!
[[eat more?->Park]]

<!--Take health-->

<h1>Search the cave</h1>
{(set:$area to "Cave")}
The cave is dark but we're not doing lighting up an area if/else item query right now.
You want treasure do you...

[Check the rusty chest?]<1a|

<!--If you want to injure the player, health bars are static so to make the bar update, you have to send the player to a new passage. Remember to add the health removing code there!-->
(click:?1a)[(goto: "Ow!")]



<!--If you don't want the player to have the option to keep injuring themselves, 
link them to another passage in this passage instead of the previous one that says something like 'I'm not sticking my hand in there again!' ect.
However if you feel mean you can have them choose repetedly to injure themselves without breaking the game by going back to the previous passage.-->

<h1>Ow!</h1>
<!--You will need to tag this hideinventory and hidequest for now to stop duplicate health removal. Not worked out a nicer way around this yet.-->
{(set:$health to $health -5)}
The chest is full of broken glass! Ouch. Who even does that?
