<!--for this to work you need a passage called Death. You could link this back to the start of your game to give players another chance.
Do not put this in the footer passage, it seems tempting to make sure you don't have to add it to every passage, but Twine won't like that.-->

<!--you can give items depending on class too! add the if/else to stop inventory item duplication. A better workaround is to send the player to a new
passage to get items potentially unless you're doing it via a click marco and you don't return to that passage. Twine is fun like that-->
